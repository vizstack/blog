# Week of 10/27/2019
**Brief Reminder:** We are building Vizstack: a suite of programming tools that visualize code structure & execution â€” for better understanding & simpler debugging in existing languages. Consider the last time you encountered an unfamilar codebase or had to debug a nasty algorithm. We believe that this code complexity can be tamed with better developer tools. We believe the time is right to reinvent the programming experience, so that developers can build bigger, faster, safer, and more intricate software.

A crucial part of our visualization library is being able to visualize **graphs**. For various reasons [outlined here](https://github.com/vizstack/blog/blob/master/WEEK-09-08.md), we've decided to develop our own graph layout library called `nodal`.

## 1. Improve `vz-pytorch` computation graph visualizer

We're continuing to work on our graph component for a neural network interpretability tool. This a great use case for many components of the Vizstack ecosystem: core, `vz-logger`, and `nodal`.

*The edges aren't the most pretty right now, because we haven't implemented orthogonal edge routing yet.*

This week, we focused on:
- Improving neural network interpretability tool
- Improving Tensor visualization
- Getting feedback from users
- Solving constraint conflicts problem
- Designing automatic alignment
- Fixing moving edges bug
- Writing compound force model

## 2. Fixed moving edges bug
