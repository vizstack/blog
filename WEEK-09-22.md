# Week of 09/22/2019
**Brief Reminder:** We are building Vizstack: a stack of programming tools that make code visual, simplifying complexity by rendering any data structure from any program in any language. Consider the last time you encountered an unfamilar codebase or had to debug a nasty algorithm. We believe that this code complexity can be tamed with better developer tools. We believe the time is right to reinvent the programming experience, so that developers can build bigger, faster, safer, and more intricate software.

## 1. Redesign core aesthetics

After getting our core visualization integrated to the `vz-logger` app, we were able to play around and gather lessons for the second iteration. The first iteration worked and was interactive, but wasn't very good looking:

- There were too many borders, creating a "pyramid of doom" aesthetic that complicated even simple data structures.
- The padding created many parallel lines, which causes you to lose your sense of context.
- The motifs (e.g. "[" and "]" at the start and end of lists) were out of place. They went against the information hierarchy, and made the viewers too tall.
- In general, the visualizations weren't very compact. Programmers have gotten used to seeing very compact (albeit limited) textual print statements in the terminal. We needed to match that as much as possible.

So we decided to do a redesign. We made the borders collapse on each other, and placed the motifs in more natural spots. All together, we made many small tweaks that we hope will add up to a more appealing display:

We'll be improving them in further iterations, as we receive more user feedback!

## 2. Improve computation graph & add `nodal` features
