# Week of 09/22/2019
**Brief Reminder:** We are building Vizstack: a stack of programming tools that make code visual, simplifying complexity by rendering any data structure from any program in any language. Consider the last time you encountered an unfamilar codebase or had to debug a nasty algorithm. We believe that this code complexity can be tamed with better developer tools. We believe the time is right to reinvent the programming experience, so that developers can build bigger, faster, safer, and more intricate software.

## 1. Redesign core aesthetics

We've made great progress towards implementing the desired features in our graph layout engine. Demos for new force models and features can be found at the link above.

## 2. Improve computation graph & add `nodal` features
