# Week of 10/06/2019
**Brief Reminder:** We are building Vizstack: a stack of programming tools that make code visual, simplifying complexity by rendering any data structure from any program in any language. Consider the last time you encountered an unfamilar codebase or had to debug a nasty algorithm. We believe that this code complexity can be tamed with better developer tools. We believe the time is right to reinvent the programming experience, so that developers can build bigger, faster, safer, and more intricate software.

A crucial part of our visualization library is being able to visualize **graphs**. For various reasons [outlined here](https://github.com/vizstack/blog/blob/master/WEEK-09-08.md), we've decided to develop our own graph layout library called `nodal`.

## 1. Improve `nodal` landing page

This week, we continued improving the `nodal` website launched last week.

Landing Page: [https://vizstack.github.io/nodal/](https://vizstack.github.io/nodal)

## 2. Improve `nodal` features

We spend over 85 hours this week (ðŸ¤“) improving various bits and pieces of `nodal`, to prepare it for its public debut:

- Allow `Circle` to constrain its children
- Allow `Circle` to constrain its ports to the boundary.
    - Both specific sides and any side
- Refactor into `StagedLayout`
- Write presets for easy use by non-graph-expert users.

## 3. Integrate into `vizstack`'s `DagLayout`
