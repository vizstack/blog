# Week of 10/13/2019
**Brief Reminder:** We are building Vizstack: a stack of programming tools that make code visual, simplifying complexity by rendering any data structure from any program in any language. Consider the last time you encountered an unfamilar codebase or had to debug a nasty algorithm. We believe that this code complexity can be tamed with better developer tools. We believe the time is right to reinvent the programming experience, so that developers can build bigger, faster, safer, and more intricate software.

A crucial part of our visualization library is being able to visualize **graphs**. For various reasons [outlined here](https://github.com/vizstack/blog/blob/master/WEEK-09-08.md), we've decided to develop our own graph layout library called `nodal`.

## 1. Finalize `nodal` landing page & repo

Landing Page: [https://vizstack.github.io/nodal/](https://vizstack.github.io/nodal)

## 2. Prototype `vz-pytorch` computation graph visualizer
