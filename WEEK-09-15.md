# Week of 09/15/2019
**Brief Reminder:** We are building Vizstack: a new stack of next-generation programming tools that make code & data structures easier to think about by rendering beautiful, interactive visualizations. Consider the last time you encountered an unfamilar codebase or had to debug a nasty algorithm. We believe that this code complexity can be tamed with better developer tools. We believe the time is right to reinvent the programming experience, so that developer can build bigger, faster, safer, and more intricate software.

## 1. Added graph layout features
Demo: [https://vizstack.github.io/nodal/docs/](https://vizstack.github.io/nodal/docs/?path=/story/force-models--spring-w-compound-nodes)

We've made great progress towards implementing the desired features in our graph layout engine. Demos for new force models and features can be found at the link above.

## 2. Fine-tuned force models

Getting the math right for the force models is tricky! We've been reading academic papers and looking at existing libraries in order to tune our engine.

## 3. Integrated with core library
Demo: [https://vizstack.github.io/vizstack/docs/](https://vizstack.github.io/vizstack/docs/?path=/story/dag-layout--interactive)

Probably the most exciting thing we did this week was integrate our new `nodal` graph layout engine into `@vizstack/core`. As we mentioned [in a previous post](https://github.com/vizstack/blog/blob/master/WEEK-09-08.md), we've never been able to find an open-source graph layout library we could tune, so decided to build our own. While we still have a ways to go — that compgraph sure looks noodley — it's great to finally have a working `DagLayout` that allows nesting of our other visualizations.
