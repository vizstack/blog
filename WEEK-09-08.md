# Week of 09/08/2019
## 1. Designed and built `nodal` graph layout library
Demo: [https://vizstack.github.io/nodal/docs/](https://vizstack.github.io/nodal/docs/)

### 1.1 Why write a graph layout library?

### 1.2 Researched state-of-the-art techniques in graph layout

- "Graph drawing by stochastic gradient descent," Zheng et al., 2018.
- "Efficient and high quality force-directed graph drawing," Hu, 2005.
- "Scalable, versatile and simple constrained graph layout," Dwyer, 2009.
- "Octilinear force-direted layout with mental map preservation for schematic diagrams," Chivers & Rodgers, 2014.
- "Integrating edge routing into force-directed layout," Dwyer et al., 2007.

### 1.3 Designed highly-modular & extensible architecture

### 1.4 Implemented spring-electrical model with nesting, ports, and hierarchy
